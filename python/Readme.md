# Getting Started with Python

You can download the current Python version on [the official Python website](https://www.python.org).
Once you have a version on your system that's higher than `3.8`, you're usually good.

## Checking the Python Version

To check the current Python version on your system, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
$ python3 --version
```

## Working With the Python Interactive Shell

To try out Python commands, you can use the Python interactive shell -- also known as Python REPL.
You can enter the Python REPL by typing `python3` and pressing ++Enter++:

```bash
$ python3
Python 3.10.0 (v3.10.0:b494f5935c, Oct  4 2021, 14:59:19) [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.11)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

If you want to exit the Python REPL, then you can type `exit()` and press ++Enter++.

## Running Python Files

To run Python files, you can use the `python3` command, followed by the path to the Python file:

```bash
$ python3 /Users/testuser/Desktop/hello.py
Hello!
```

If you're in the same folder as the Python file, then you can use the filename directly:

```bash
$ python3 hello.py
Hello!
```
