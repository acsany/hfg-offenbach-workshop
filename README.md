## Contributing to this Repository
After creating a Git user account, you need to create a **SSH Key** on your computer to be able to push changes to this repository.
A SSH Key is a unique identifier on your computer that let's GitHub know that you are really _you_. 
To create and connect a SSH Key with your GitHub account, you need to follow the steps outlined on these pages:

1. [Check for existing SSH Keys on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
2. [Generate a new SSH Key, if necessary](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
3. [Add the existing or new SSH Key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Once you've connected your local SSH Key with GitHub, you need to make sure that the remote repository address is the SSH address: 

|✅ Correct Address | ❗️ Read-only address |
| --- | --- |
| `git@github.com:acsany/hfg-offenbach-workshop.git` | `https://github.com/acsany/hfg-offenbach-workshop.git`|
